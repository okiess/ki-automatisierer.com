# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a static HTML website for ki-automatisierer.com, a German AI automation services landing page by Oliver Kie√üler. The site consists of simple HTML files with inline CSS and no build process.

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Main landing page with placeholder content (marked as TODO)
- `impressum.html` - German legal imprint page
- `datenschutz.html` - German privacy policy page  
- `sitemap.xml` - XML sitemap for search engines
- `CNAME` - GitHub Pages domain configuration

## Development Notes

- No build tools, package managers, or frameworks used
- All styling is inline CSS within HTML files
- Content is primarily in German
- Main page contains TODO placeholders that need completion
- Site uses semantic HTML with Schema.org markup for SEO
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Links to external site: https://ki-automatisierer-koeln.de

## Deployment

This appears to be configured for deployment via GitHub Pages (CNAME file present). No build or deployment commands needed - files are served directly as static HTML.
